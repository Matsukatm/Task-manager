This Task Management application is a simple web-based tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently.
It is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, which handles the backend logic and routing.
The frontend is crafted with HTML for structure and CSS for styling, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
The application allows users to add tasks via a form, which are then displayed in a list, and provides the functionality to delete tasks as needed. 
The entire process involves setting up the project structure,
creating templates for the frontend, 
implementing the backend logic with Flask,
and running the application on a local server for testing and usage.
